My dearest Sophie,

As I have been thinking about all that has changed, I’ve found myself ruminating on the one thing that hasn’t, rocks.  Looking out at the mountains on the horizon or the boulders that litter the desert, it would be impossible for me to cite anything that truly felt different from when I looked at these very same structures in my youth.  

There is a comfort in that fact.  No matter how badly us humans screw up, mountains will still stand in defiance of us.  Even at the height of our technological power, no one would dare challenge a mountain.  Theoretically, we could have blown them away.  It’s not as if explosives left no trace whatsoever, but fully obliterating a mountain would have required such a monumental effort that it would be laughable to even suggest.  Nature, in some form, shall outlive us all.  Do not forget that fact.

Sincerely, 
Grandfather Ryan
