Dear Grandpa,

When you sent me your first letter, you told me to take from it what I must.  I’ve followed that advice as well as I can.  I never know what to expect when one of your letters arrives, and that mystery is half of the fun for me.  As far as I know, your next letter could have stories of trees larger than I’ve ever seen, or descriptions of peculiar creatures, or who knows what else.  

When I read your most recent letter, you helped me solve a mystery that has been bugging me for months.  You talk a lot about the past.  That isn’t surprising of course.  In your first letter, you told me you wanted to make your memories real for me.  I truly admire your effort, but I have never fully left my own reality.  The letters are interesting, and they give me things to think about, but so far I haven’t been brought to a new world.  I wasn’t able to explain why this was the case until I read your newest letter.  

You write about beauty in the past tense.  It is an object that once was and shall never be again.  I don’t doubt that the old world was a beautiful place, but I let that blind me to the world I do have.  The story of your trip through the forest in the desert moved me because it exists now.  Perhaps beauty isn’t some innate quality that the world does or doesn’t have, but is something we build for ourselves as we live our lives.  I’ve only ever known this world, but I can still see the beauty in it.  It’s in the way dust dances for me in the wind, or the brilliance of the night sky, or in the communities I share.  I can’t ask you to ignore the beauty you built early in your life, but don’t allow your past to rob you of your present.  

Sincerely, 
Sophie
