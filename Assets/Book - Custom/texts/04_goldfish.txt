My dearest Sophie, 

Would you believe me if I told you that there was a time when people not only kept fish as pets?  I know it’s hard to believe, but it’s true.  And don’t get the wrong impression, owning a fish wasn’t some extravagance that kings would use to flaunt their wealth.  Quite the opposite in fact.  Home aquariums were commonplace.  In fact, when I was young I had a fish myself.

I didn’t actually want a fish.  My heart was set on getting a cat, preferably one with a big fluffy tail.  My love for cats was one that only a child could muster.  Pure and unburdened by the worry you might eventually lose your beloved.  My parents told me I wasn’t old enough to handle the responsibilities of owning a cat, but that didn’t stop me from asking them again the next day.  And the next.  Eventually, they offered me a compromise.  If I could keep a goldfish alive, they would consider letting me get a cat.  Maybe.  

When I got home from the pet store, I clutched a goldfish in a plastic bag tightly against my chest as I gingerly climbed the staircase, pausing for at least a second after each step.  Once the goldfish, who I had named Bub, was safely in his aquarium, I watched this strange creature for a few minutes and walked away to do whatever else I wanted to do that afternoon.  Looking back, there’s something darkly humorous about this whole situation.  Bub was entirely oblivious to the mercenary bargain that altered the trajectory of his life, that to me he was little more than a bargaining chip for some greater reward.  He was well cared for the duration of his slightly shorter than average life.  

The world in which I am writing this letter is far removed from the world of Bub, and I don’t think I can explain how we got here.  Sure, I lived through these drastic changes, watched the world become one where Bub would have been priceless.  Perhaps I should have realized that he always was.  

Sincerely, 
Grandfather Ryan
