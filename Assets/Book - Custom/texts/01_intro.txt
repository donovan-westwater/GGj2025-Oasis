My Dearest Sophie,

A few nights ago, as I was wiping the dust off my solar panels, I saw a firefly.  Or at least, I’m pretty sure that’s what happened.  When I explained the rhythmically pulsating glow that I saw, my friends laughed heartily at my ‘joke’, before realizing that I was entirely serious. They tell me that my eyesight is finally going or that I had merely gotten all worked up over some forgotten bit of machinery.  Marcy, ever the superstitious type, explained to me that I had seen a ghost of the old world!  I can’t entirely blame them for their preposterous suggestions.  If I was in their position, perhaps it would be easier for me to believe in elaborately woven ghost stories than in the fact that fireflies somehow still existed.  

Regardless, ever since I’ve been thinking back on my youth.  It has been so long since I’ve let myself think about these things.  At some point I convinced myself that if I could forget my past, I wouldn’t constantly be faced with all that I had lost.  If the world had always been dust storms and ash, I could ground myself in the inescapable present.  What foolishness!  

It isn’t just the firefly that is occupying my thoughts now.  My head has become such a lush world, and I want you to know this place too.  I’m going to make my memories real for you, or as real as I can feasibly make them.  Take from them whatever you must.  Please.

Sincerely,
Grandfather Ryan
